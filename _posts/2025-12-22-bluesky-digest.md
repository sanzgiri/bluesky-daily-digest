### **Cybersecurity Whistleblower: The DOGE Debacle**
Think a meme cryptocurrency like DOGE couldn’t spark serious trouble? Think again. A federal whistleblower has revealed alarming claims that data breaches linked to DOGE are opening the door for cybercriminals, specifically rousing Russian hackers to attempt logins using DOGE passwords. This isn’t just tech gossip; it’s a stark reminder of how the crypto world can intersect with national security concerns.

* "He's saying DOGE came in, data went out, and Russians started attempting logins with new valid DOGE passwords." [— @mattjay.com](https://bsky.app/profile/mattjay.com/post/3ln2dgoksce2e)

### **Python’s Ethical Turn: A $1.5M Decision**
In a bold move, the Python Software Foundation has chosen ethics over revenue by rejecting a $1.5 million grant to prioritize community values of diversity and inclusion. This decision not only reflects a growing trend in tech to align financial opportunities with ethical commitments, but it also challenges other organizations to consider what truly matters in their missions.

* "The PSF has made the decision to put our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead of seeking $1.5M in new revenue." [— @python.org](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)
* "Unbelievably based we love to see it." [— @katie.bzky.team](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)

### **Wealth and Madness: The New Aristocracy?**
John Rogers raises eyebrows with his take on the state of democracy, suggesting that the ultra-rich, often behaving like "grotty twelve year olds," are a threat to social order. His commentary prompts us to consider the implications of wealth concentration and how it could lead to societal madness—raising questions about accountability and the moral responsibilities of the wealthy.

* "The fact the richest men in the West are a mix of grotty twelve year olds and deranged apocalypse fanatics is a problem." [— @johnrogers.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/johnrogers.bsky.social/post/3m3nebgaub223)
* "Extremes of wealth encourage madness." [— @theodoric.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/johnrogers.bsky.social/post/3m3nebgaub223)

### **Independent Media: The Call for Support**
Marisa Kabas strikes a chord with her straightforward plea to support independent media, a clarion call amid a landscape dominated by corporate giants. Her post underscores the critical role that independent voices play in democracy, especially when traditional media often falls prey to oligarchic influences. In an age where information is power, supporting independent outlets is not just a choice; it’s a necessity.

* "Support independent media. idk what else to say right now." [— @marisakabas.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3makbvjfzmk2l)
* "The billionaires control the dictator, the Supreme Court, maga and all the media." [— @workingclasshero76](https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3makbvjfzmk2l)

### **Cartoon Creators vs. Government Officials: A Surreal Disavowal**
Giraffe Or Possibly Popehat delivers a hilarious yet pointed critique of a U.S. Secretary of Defense, likening him to a “drunken miscreant.” This absurdist comparison serves as a reminder of the sometimes ridiculous intersection of pop culture and politics, highlighting how even beloved characters must navigate the murky waters of governmental associations.

* "Normally the creators of beloved children’s cartoon characters would not need to disavow the U.S. Secretary of Defense." [— @kenwhite.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/kenwhite.bsky.social/post/3m6xzw7z5b22q)
* "I think comparing him to a counterfeit buttplug is a dishonor to the buttplug." [— @spotts1701](https://bsky.app/profile/kenwhite.bsky.social/post/3m6xzw7z5b22q)

As we navigate these tangled webs of tech, ethics, and culture, one thing is clear: the conversations we’re having today will shape the world we live in tomorrow.
