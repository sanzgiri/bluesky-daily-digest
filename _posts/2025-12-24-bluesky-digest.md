### **The Digital Whistleblower: A Cybersecurity Wake-Up Call**
Just when you thought it was safe to log in, a federal whistleblower has dropped a bombshell that could rattle the foundations of your online security.

This isn’t just another headline; it’s a stark reminder of how vulnerable we really are in the digital age.

### **Democracy and the Deranged: A Call for Sanity**
In an age where the ultra-wealthy often seem detached from reality, John Rogers presents a compelling case: our democracy relies on ensuring that one individual’s bizarre worldview doesn’t dictate the collective fate. The mix of mischief-makers and doomsday enthusiasts among the richest is more than a quirk—it's a systemic issue that needs addressing.

* "The whole point of democracy is so one person's derangement does not become everybody's problem." [— @johnrogers.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/johnrogers.bsky.social/post/3m3nebgaub223)

### **Python’s Bold Stand for Values Over Revenue**
The Python Software Foundation just made a refreshing move that prioritizes community values over cold hard cash— opting out of a $1.5 million grant to uphold their diversity, equity, and inclusion principles. This decision signals a shift in how organizations view their responsibilities and the lengths they will go to protect their core values.

* "The PSF has made the decision to put our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead of seeking $1.5M in new revenue." [— @python.org](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)

Their proactive approach is not just a national strategy; it's a blueprint for countries worldwide grappling with the fallout of misinformation.

### **AI: The WeWork of Tech?**
As skepticism surrounding AI continues to mount, former OpenAI insider Gary Marcus raises eyebrows by likening it to the infamous WeWork debacle. With questions about profitability and sustainability, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the AI narrative might need a serious rewrite.

* "As skepticism of AI deepens, we keep coming back to this Gary Marcus interview from May — where he argued OpenAI would be 'the WeWork of AI.'" [— @carlquintanilla.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/carlquintanilla.bsky.social/post/3m57memcibc2o)
