### **Wikipedia Turns 25: A Triumph of Unpaid Rascals**
Happy birthday to Wikipedia, the last bastion of collective knowledge that hasn’t succumbed to “enshittification.” Celebrating 25 years, this online treasure trove is a testament to humanity’s quirky urge to correct one another—mostly powered by unpaid volunteers who keep the information flowing. As one user quipped, "Good thing Wikipedia works in practice, because it sure doesn't work in theory," underscoring the beautiful chaos of collaborative editing.

### **The Python Foundation's Bold Move: Values Over Cash**
In a surprising twist that could redefine tech philanthropy, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) has chosen to prioritize community values over a potential $1.5 million grant. In an era of relentless revenue chase, this decision sends a powerful message: inclusivity and diversity take precedence over financial gain. As one enthusiastic supporter noted, this is “unbelievably based,” reflecting a growing trend where organizations are aligning their missions with their ethical compass rather than just their wallets.

*   "The PSF has made the decision to put our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead." [— @python.org](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)

### **Social Hygiene: A Call to Sanitize the Digital Space**
As the digital landscape becomes increasingly chaotic, John Rogers raises a compelling point about the need for social hygiene in democracy. His assertion that one person's derangement shouldn’t dictate the collective experience resonates in today’s climate, where wealth and influence often breed madness. The question looms: how do we reclaim our spaces from those whose agendas threaten our shared sanity? This is a moment for introspection and action.

*   "The whole point of democracy is so one person's derangement does not become everybody's problem." [— @johnrogers.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/johnrogers.bsky.social/post/3m3nebgaub223)
*   "Extremes of wealth encourage madness." [— @theodoric.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/johnrogers.bsky.social/post/3m3nebgaub223)

### **Block Party: The Nuclear Option in Digital Interactions**
In the digital age, blocking might just be the new form of protest. Robert McNees advocates for an immediate and total block of provocateurs, arguing that their primary goal is to sow discord. This raises an interesting question: in a world rife with negativity, can we curate our feeds to create a more harmonious online existence? The power of the block button could redefine how we engage—or disengage—with discordant voices.

*   "You have to block them immediately. The full nuclear." [— @mcnees.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/mcnees.bsky.social/post/3mclclers222p)
*   "They’re here to stir shit up." [— @mcnees.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/mcnees.bsky.social/post/3mclclers222p)

### **Disinformation and the Call to Action**
As concerns over disinformation mount, a new initiative is calling for scholars and activists to tackle this crucial issue head-on. With a star-studded lineup including some of the sharpest minds in the field, this gathering aims to equip participants with the tools needed to combat the pervasive spread of falsehoods. In a time when the truth often feels like a fragile concept, this could be a pivotal moment for those passionate about safeguarding information integrity.

*   "Do you study disinformation or want to start working in that area?" [— @carlbergstrom.com](https://bsky.app/profile/carlbergstrom.com/post/3mcmk4mbeks2p)
*   "Okay how many attendees just want to learn how to do it better?" [— @seanmcarroll.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/carlbergstrom.com/post/3mcmk4mbeks2p)

As we navigate this complex web of information, it’s clear that our choices—whether to block, celebrate, or confront—will shape the future of our digital interactions and societal values. Let's choose wisely!
