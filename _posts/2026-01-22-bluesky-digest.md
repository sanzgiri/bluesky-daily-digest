### **The Great Trade-Off: Values vs. Revenue in Tech**
Today, the Python Software Foundation made a bold statement that’s resonating through the tech community: they’re prioritizing community and diversity over a potential $1.5 million grant. This decision isn’t just about money; it reflects a growing sentiment that values should come first, especially in an industry often criticized for its lack of inclusivity. As one user put it, the move is "unbelievably based," suggesting that the tides may be turning toward a more principled tech landscape.

*   "The PSF has made the decision to put our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead of seeking $1.5M in new revenue." [— @python.org](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)
*   "I’m another mostly-python developer whose career was derailed in large part due to this administration..." [— @viralpersistence.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)

### **Democracy or Derangement?**
In a striking critique of wealth and power dynamics, John Rogers argues that the essence of democracy is to prevent individual madness from becoming a collective nightmare. With the richest among us often resembling “grotty twelve-year-olds” or “deranged apocalypse fanatics,” it’s a call to arms for accountability. This perspective highlights a crucial intersection of wealth inequality and mental health, echoing a growing fear that extreme wealth breeds extreme ideologies. 

*   "The fact the richest men in the West are a mix of grotty twelve year olds and deranged apocalypse fanatics is a problem." [— @johnrogers.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/johnrogers.bsky.social/post/3m3nebgaub223)
*   "Extremes of wealth encourage madness." [— @theodoric.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/johnrogers.bsky.social/post/3m3nebgaub223)

### **Mapping the Mind: A Boycott for Clarity**
Joe Hanson has taken a stand against the Mercator projection, calling for a boycott in all stories about Greenland. His argument? The misleading map creates a distorted view of the world, contributing to misconceptions that can have real-world implications. With the planet facing climate crises, perhaps it’s time we start with an accurate representation of our geography—after all, how we visualize the world shapes our understanding of it.

*   "I am calling for a complete and total boycott of the Mercator projection in all news stories about Greenland..." [— @drjoehanson.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/drjoehanson.bsky.social/post/3mcd3kanaxs2u)

### **The Rogue Bus Guy Chronicles**
In a lighter vein, the internet’s affection for the “rogue bus guy” continues to flourish, with playful banter surrounding his new job. It’s a reminder that sometimes, amidst the serious discourse, we need a chuckle or two. The absurdity of the situation, including the question of where he’ll park his bus in Vienna, VA, illustrates how humor can unite us, even when the world feels divided.

*   "Congratulations to rogue bus guy on the new job." [— @irhottakes.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/irhottakes.bsky.social/post/3mcvqqz3jo22j)

### **AI: The WeWork of Tomorrow?**
As skepticism surrounding AI intensifies, Gary Marcus’s prescient comparison of OpenAI to WeWork resurfaces, raising eyebrows. The implication is clear: just as WeWork’s financials unraveled, so too might AI if it doesn’t find a sustainable path forward. This reflection is crucial as we navigate the complex landscape of artificial intelligence and its implications for the economy and society at large.

*   "As skepticism of AI deepens, we keep coming back to this Gary Marcus interview from May..." [— @carlquintanilla.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/carlquintanilla.bsky.social/post/3m57memcibc2o)

In a day filled with bold decisions, biting critiques, and whimsical internet moments, what stands out is the persistent tension between values and profit, reality and perception. As we move forward, it’s essential to keep questioning not just what we see, but how we choose to represent and act upon it.
