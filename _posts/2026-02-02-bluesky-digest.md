### **The Cruelty of Bureaucracy: A Call to Action**
Today, the discourse surrounding immigration and government accountability took a sharp turn with Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani's powerful condemnation of ICE's violent actions. His stark remarks on the recent murders of Renée Good and Alex Pretti highlight the urgent need for reform. This isn't merely an issue of policy—it's a matter of human lives, and the outcry against the agency's brutality is growing louder. As Mamdani emphasizes, “We can't allow ourselves to look away from this cruelty,” the public sentiment against ICE’s existence is gaining traction.

### **Gaming vs. Governance: Who's Really in Charge?**
In an ironic twist, it appears gaming platforms may be stepping up in ways that traditional institutions are failing. A tweet pointed out that "Xbox Live took stronger action against Jeffrey Epstein than the entire US government." It’s a stark reminder of the disparity between corporate responsibility and governmental accountability. As users grapple with the ludicrousness of this reality, the discussion pivots to the broader implications of how society measures accountability and justice in the digital age.

### **The Future of Tech Funding: Prioritizing Values Over Profits**
The Python Software Foundation has made waves by deciding to prioritize community values over a hefty $1.5 million grant. This decision underscores a growing trend in tech where organizations are reevaluating their goals in favor of inclusivity and diversity. As Kelsey Hightower points out, the real measure of success lies in meaningful engagement rather than vanity metrics. The PSF’s commitment to these ideals may signal a shift in how tech communities view funding and sustainability.

*   "The PSF has made the decision to put our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead of seeking $1.5M in new revenue." [— @python.org](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)

### **A Creative Act of Resistance Against AI**
In Quilicura, Chile, a grassroots initiative has emerged to challenge the dominance of AI by promoting human interaction instead. The project invites residents to sidestep AI for local insights. This act of defiance against the encroaching tide of technology invites us to question our reliance on artificial intelligence. As global communities begin to assert their autonomy in this way, it raises an intriguing question: could this be the beginning of a broader movement advocating for human-centric engagement?

*   "Today, don't use AI; ask the townspeople instead: quili.ai. So heartened to see this creative act of resistance." [— @karenhao.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/karenhao.bsky.social/post/3mdpw5wczdk2d)

This breakthrough has sparked discussions about the role of AI in healthcare and the implications of such technology on patient outcomes. With AI now proving its worth in real-world applications, the question looms: how will this shape the future of medical practices and patient care?
