### **Abolishing ICE: The Human Cost of Indifference**
Today, the conversation around immigration took a dark turn as voices rose against the cruelty of ICE. New York's Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani boldly declared, “ICE murdered Renée Good in broad daylight,” highlighting a chilling pattern of violence that’s become all too familiar. His call to “abolish ICE” isn’t just a political stance; it’s a desperate plea to recognize the humanity behind policy. As stories of lives lost pile up, the urgency for reform becomes a moral imperative. We can’t afford to look away—these aren’t just headlines; they are lives shattered.

### **The AI Dilemma: Benefactor or Parasite?**
In the tech world, a new narrative is brewing about the role of AI and its wealthy backers. Recent revelations reveal that the largest donor to Trump's superPAC is none other than the president of OpenAI. This connection raises eyebrows and questions about the ethics of AI development amidst political maneuvering. Critics are quick to label billionaires as “parasites,” suggesting that their thirst for influence might eclipse the altruistic facade of innovation. As we navigate this tangled web of politics and technology, the stakes couldn’t be higher for our democratic processes.

### **Community Over Cash: Python’s Bold Move**
In a surprising twist, the Python Software Foundation has chosen ethics over profit, deciding to prioritize community values over a potential $1.5 million grant. This decision may seem counterintuitive in a world where funding often dictates direction, but it represents a refreshing commitment to diversity and inclusion. By placing shared values at the forefront, the PSF is setting a powerful example for tech organizations everywhere. As we grapple with the ethical dilemmas posed by profit-driven motives, this move highlights a growing trend toward prioritizing community needs over financial gain.

### **Chilean Innovation: A Creative Act of Resistance**
In a fascinating case of grassroots activism, the community of Quilicura, Chile, is launching an initiative that challenges the dominance of AI in decision-making. Instead of relying solely on algorithms, they're encouraging people to engage with their neighbors for insights— “don’t use AI; ask the townspeople instead.” This initiative serves as a reminder that technology should enhance human connection, not replace it. As communities assert their agency against the encroachment of AI, we’re witnessing a powerful pushback that values human experience over data-driven responses.

* “Today, don't use AI; ask the townspeople instead: quili.ai.” [— @karenhao.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/karenhao.bsky.social/post/3mdpw5wczdk2d)  
* “I love this!!” [— @jessicaschaefer.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/karenhao.bsky.social/post/3mdpw5wczdk2d)

As we navigate these pressing issues, it's clear that the intersection of technology, humanity, and ethics is more relevant than ever. The choices we make today will shape the narratives of tomorrow.
