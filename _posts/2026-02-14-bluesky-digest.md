### **Python Foundation Prioritizes Values Over Cash**
In a bold move that prioritizes community values over profit, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) has opted not to pursue a $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation. This decision underscores a growing trend in tech: the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion is taking precedence over financial gain. The PSF’s commitment reflects an industry grappling with its ethical responsibilities, suggesting that financial resources may not always align with the greater good.

*   "The PSF applied for a $1.5M grant from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) to make innovative improvements, but we decided to prioritize our values." [— @python.org](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)

### **The Art of Digital Muteness**
Tristan Gray’s latest update to the GenAI mute/block list is a testament to the power of community-driven moderation in a noisy digital landscape. By actively curating our feeds, we gain control over our online experience, allowing us to filter out the noise and focus on what truly matters. This isn’t just about personal preference; it speaks volumes about the desire for healthier online interactions.

*   "In honour of Hayao Miyazaki, I've implemented the biggest update to the GenAI mute/block list in months. Clear your feed." [— @eidyngray.scot](https://bsky.app/profile/eidyngray.scot/post/3lm7mwf2mqs2h)

### **The Thin Line Between Rage and Routine**
The struggle to maintain a positive demeanor while dealing with dark realities is a common theme in today’s chaotic world. As some users navigate the bleakness of current events, they’re also finding humor in it—like the user who quips about the absurdity of having to suppress their outrage for the sake of professionalism. It’s a reminder that our online personas often mask deeper frustrations, revealing a collective fatigue with the state of things.

*   "Minimizing the window where I read about how our world is a joke and we're at the mercy of megalomaniacal evil perverts." [— @internethippo.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/internethippo.bsky.social/post/3mdysi6ppnc27)

### **Politics Meets AI Funding**
In a twist that embodies the intersection of technology and politics, it’s revealed that the largest superPAC donor supporting Trump is none other than the president of OpenAI. This startling connection raises eyebrows and questions about the influence of AI leaders in shaping political landscapes. As AI continues to permeate various sectors, the implications of such financial support could have far-reaching effects on both technology and governance.

*   "The largest Trump superPAC donor so far this cycle is the president of OpenAI." [— @jakemgrumbach.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/jakemgrumbach.bsky.social/post/3mdbzv2nfsc2k)
*   "They are 100% targeting a future bailout." [— @mrhassel](https://bsky.app/profile/jakemgrumbach.bsky.social/post/3mdbzv2nfsc2k)

### **Surveillance and Social Media: A Dangerous Dance**
The Department of Homeland Security's recent actions to identify critics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raise significant concerns about privacy and surveillance in the digital age. By sending legal requests to tech companies for the identities of social media users, the government is crossing a line that pits national security against civil liberties. This isn't just a tech issue; it’s a societal one that could redefine the boundaries of free speech.

*   "[DHS] is expanding its efforts to identify Americans who oppose Immigration and Customs Enforcement by sending tech companies legal requests for identifying data." [— @justinhendrix](https://bsky.app/profile/justinhendrix.bsky.social/post/3merxifzirk2p)
*   "Doesn’t this mean every single account holder still using Meta, Reddit, Google, etc. should be worried?" [— @pilarva](https://bsky.app/profile/justinhendrix.bsky.social/post/3merxifzirk2p)

In a world where tech, ethics, and politics collide, today’s posts offer a snapshot of the ongoing dialogues shaping our future. Whether it’s the ethical stances of organizations or the implications of AI in politics, the threads connecting these discussions are more relevant than ever.
