### **Python Prioritizes Principles Over Profits**
In a bold move that sends ripples through the tech community, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) has chosen to prioritize its values of diversity, equity, and inclusion over a potential $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation. This decision isn't just about money; it's a stand against the pressures of funding that often compromise core principles. As one observer noted, "unbelievably based we love to see it" — a sentiment that echoes the collective relief and pride in prioritizing community over capital.

### **Miyazaki Meets Mute: A Digital Cleanse**
In an era where online noise can drown out meaningful discourse, Tristan Gray is stepping up with a significant update to his GenAI mute/block list. Inspired by the legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki, this initiative is all about curating a digital space that reflects personal values and promotes mental wellness. As one follower humorously pointed out, "Big fan of how the first account is Adobe," highlighting that even the giants of tech can find themselves on the chopping block. This is more than just a tech update; it's a call to take control of our feeds and, by extension, our mental health.

### **Tragedy and Triumph: The Dual Nature of News**
The heartbreaking news of Ofelia Torres, a young cancer fighter whose story became emblematic of government overreach, serves as a stark reminder of the real human toll behind policy decisions. Torres's death has sparked outrage, with one user passionately declaring, "When will we call it depraved lawlessness, instead of anodyne 'overreach'?" This juxtaposition of personal tragedy against the backdrop of systemic issues calls for reflection on how we engage with the narratives surrounding us — the triumphs and tragedies that shape our society.

### **SuperPAC Shenanigans: AI’s Political Ties**
In a twist that could make for a gripping political thriller, the largest donor to a Trump superPAC is none other than the president of OpenAI. This revelation raises eyebrows about the intersection of technology and politics, especially as AI continues to shape the future of communication and misinformation. One commentator quipped, "ChatGPT is the equivalent of a dog scooting its asshole across the carpet threads of your brain," highlighting the absurdity and complexity of AI's role in our political landscape. As we navigate this space, questions about accountability and influence loom large.

### **A Momentary Laugh Amid the Chaos**
In a world laden with heavy news, sometimes a viral moment can serve as a much-needed balm. A humorous slo-mo clip of an ice crew member taking a tumble during a women's hockey game has captured hearts, reminding us that laughter can still thrive even in challenging times. As one viewer aptly noted, "give em an emmy," encapsulating the joy that spontaneous moments of levity bring to our lives. This serves as a reminder that amid the turmoil, a little laughter can go a long way.

*   "What follows is the funniest use of the slo-mo alternate angle tech I've seen..." [— @dreyesceron.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/dreyesceron.bsky.social/post/3meuavqrby22z)
*   "credit to r/hockey for the find as I totally missed this earlier." [— @dreyesceron.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/dreyesceron.bsky.social/post/3meuavqrby22z) 

As we wrap up today, remember: whether it's standing firm on principles, curating your digital experience, confronting our societal shortcomings, navigating political absurdities, or simply finding joy in the little things, each moment is a chance to engage with the world in a meaningful way.
