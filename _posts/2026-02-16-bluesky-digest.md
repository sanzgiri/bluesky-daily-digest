### **Python's Bold Move for Inclusivity**
In a refreshing twist, the Python Software Foundation has chosen community values over profit, opting not to pursue a $1.5M grant from the National Science Foundation. This decision underscores a growing trend where organizations prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion over sheer financial gain, signaling a shift in the tech landscape. As the PSF stated, “We believe that our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values should come first” — a sentiment that resonates deeply in today’s socio-political climate. This isn’t just about Python; it’s a challenge to the status quo that other organizations might take note of.

### **Africa's Solar Surge: A Bright Future?**
While the U.S. seems to be doubling down on fossil fuels, Africa is charging ahead with solar energy, adding capacity at a breakneck pace. In 2025, the continent’s solar installations skyrocketed, showcasing a potential model for sustainable energy that contrasts sharply with the regressive energy policies of some Western nations. As one observer pointed out, “What’s happening there is solar is not only the cheapest and fastest way to add electric power…” This energy revolution in Africa isn’t just about electricity; it’s a lifeline for economic development and climate resilience that the rest of the world should pay attention to.

### **Doomscrolling vs. Book Reading: A Battle for Time**
Chanda Prescod-Weinstein raises an interesting point: is our obsession with doomscrolling robbing us of precious time once dedicated to reading? In an age where our feeds are filled with relentless bad news, it’s easy to lose sight of literature that can inspire and uplift. One user candidly remarked, “I have to fight the cheap dopamine and force myself to pick up a book every day…” This ongoing struggle between digital engagement and intellectual nourishment reflects a broader societal concern about our consumption habits and the quality of our leisure time.

* "I wonder if people are paying attention to how much their doom scrolling is cutting into time they used to use to read books" [— @chanda.blacksky.app](https://bsky.app/profile/chanda.blacksky.app/post/3metaidd7bc26)
* "I'm just scrolling. Not my fault there's so much doom 🤷‍♀️" [— @lisa-frank.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/chanda.blacksky.app/post/3metaidd7bc26)

### **The Dark Side of Dynamic Pricing**
Ronan Farrow’s exploration of “surveillance pricing” reveals a chilling trend where companies use individual data to set prices based on what they think you’re willing to pay. This isn’t just about rides and tickets; it’s infiltrating wages too, with algorithms determining pay based on predicted thresholds. As Farrow notes, “dynamic rates are coming for wages too,” which poses a significant threat to fair compensation practices. This kind of market manipulation blurs the line between capitalism and exploitation, and it’s a wake-up call for consumers to demand transparency and equity in pricing.

* "Surveillance Pricing takes this to the next level: using your data to set a 'price for you' based on your predicted breaking point." [— @ronanfarrow](https://bsky.app/profile/ronanfarrow.bsky.social/post/3memdmltpei2m)
* "This needs to be outlawed--it is PREDATION and an extreme violation of privacy." [— @pppatticake](https://bsky.app/profile/ronanfarrow.bsky.social/post/3memdmltpei2m)

### **Community Compassion in Action**
A heartwarming moment unfolded when a community member handed off a poignant piece of history to a local patroller, illustrating the profound impact of shared compassion. This small act sparked an outpouring of emotion online, with one user reflecting, “This is legitimately the kind of stuff that changes people for good.” In a world often mired in negativity, these moments of human connection remind us of our collective power to uplift one another and foster genuine community ties, proving that kindness can indeed be a transformative force.
