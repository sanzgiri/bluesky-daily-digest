### **Remembering a GPS Pioneer: Gladys West Passes Away**
Today, the tech world paused to honor Dr. Gladys West, the brilliant mathematician whose work was pivotal in shaping our GPS technology. At 95, her legacy reminds us that innovation often starts from the minds of those who quietly toil behind the scenes. Without her contributions, our lives—quite literally—might be a lot more directionless.

### **The Python Foundation Chooses Community Over Cash**
In a bold move, the Python Software Foundation decided to prioritize community values over a hefty $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation. This isn’t just about money; it’s a statement that diversity and inclusion are more valuable than short-term revenue. In a world where many organizations chase funding at any cost, the PSF’s decision stands as a beacon of integrity.

### **Wealth and Madness: A Democratic Dilemma**
John Rogers stirred the pot with his take on democracy and wealth, suggesting that the richest among us often resemble “grotty twelve year olds and deranged apocalypse fanatics.” His words hit hard—this isn’t just a critique of wealth but a call to address the societal implications of unchecked power. When wealth breeds madness, it’s a problem for all of us, and his remarks resonate with growing disenchantment toward the ultra-rich.

### **AI: The Hype and the Hangover**
With skepticism about AI on the rise, today’s chatter included a striking MIT study revealing that 95% of companies integrating AI saw no real growth. Meanwhile, tech analyst Gary Marcus drew parallels between OpenAI and WeWork, highlighting a concerning trend of inflated promises and unmet expectations. As we grapple with these revelations, the question looms: Are we ready to face the consequences of our AI ambitions?

* “OpenAI would be the WeWork of AI.” [— @garymarcus.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/carlquintanilla.bsky.social/post/3m57memcib2o)

### **Cows with Tools: A Surprising Discovery**
In a delightful twist of animal intelligence, researchers have revealed that cows can use tools, challenging our long-held beliefs about these bovine buddies. This discovery not only reshapes our understanding of animal cognition but also begs the question: what else might we be underestimating in the animal kingdom? It’s time we reconsider our relationship with the creatures we’ve domesticated for millennia.

* “We have lived alongside cows for nearly 10,000 years. It is now, only now, that we have discovered THEY CAN USE TOOLS.” [— @biotay.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/biotay.bsky.social/post/3mcs5uabapc2n)
* “Remarkably sophisticated!” [— @1ijk.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/biotay.bsky.social/post/3mcs5uabapc2n)

As we reflect on these varied topics today, one thing stands out: whether it’s honoring a pioneering mathematician or questioning the very foundations of our economic structures, the threads of innovation, ethics, and understanding weave through our collective consciousness. Let's keep the dialogue going!
