### **Remembering a Trailblazer: Dr. Gladys West Passes Away**
Today, we mourn the loss of Dr. Gladys West, a mathematician whose groundbreaking work was pivotal in developing GPS technology. At 95, her legacy is a reminder of the profound impact that one woman's intellect can have on the world, helping us navigate both physically and metaphorically. As we reflect on her life, it’s worth considering how often we overlook the contributions of women in STEM and the need for greater recognition of their achievements.

### **The Great AI Skepticism Showdown**
As skepticism around AI hits a fever pitch, voices like Gary Marcus are echoing concerns that companies like OpenAI may be the "WeWork of AI." This isn't just idle speculation; it’s a wake-up call to the tech industry to reassess its trajectory and the narratives we’re all buying into. Are we steering toward innovation, or are we cruising for a crash?

### **Democracy in the Age of the Ultra-Rich**
John Rogers raises a provocative point about the dangers of wealth concentration in democracy, likening some of the super-rich to “grotty twelve-year-olds.” His commentary hits at the heart of a growing concern: how do we safeguard democracy when a few individuals hold so much power? This isn’t just philosophical; it’s practical, as we witness the real-world implications of unchecked power dynamics.

*   "The whole point of democracy is so one person's derangement does not become everybody's problem." [— @johnrogers.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/johnrogers.bsky.social/post/3m3nebgaub223)
*   "Extremes of wealth encourage madness." [— @theodoric.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/johnrogers.bsky.social/post/3m3nebgaub223)

### **A New Kind of Social Hygiene**
In an unusual twist, the digital world is getting a makeover thanks to Tristan Gray’s latest update to the GenAI mute/block list, celebrating Hayao Miyazaki. This isn’t just about clearing your feed but highlights the growing recognition that our online spaces need curating and care, much like our physical environments. It's a reminder that digital hygiene is just as crucial as social hygiene, and we’re all responsible for it.

### **The Mercator Projection: A Cartographic Conspiracy?**
Joe Hanson’s call for a boycott of the Mercator projection in Greenland’s media coverage raises eyebrows and questions the very narrative we accept about geography. It’s a playful yet serious critique of how our maps can distort reality, making us reconsider what "truth" looks like in our visual representations. Are we ready to rethink our cartographic choices?

*   "I am calling for a complete and total boycott of the Mercator projection..." [— @drjoehanson.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/drjoehanson.bsky.social/post/3mcd3kanaxs2u)

As we navigate these diverse conversations, it’s clear that the implications of our technological and societal choices are more interconnected than we might think. Let’s keep questioning, keep discussing, and keep our minds open.
