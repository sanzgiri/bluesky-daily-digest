### **Abolish ICE: A Call to Action Amidst Tragedy**
Today, the haunting reality of immigration enforcement was thrust into the spotlight after Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani’s powerful statement about the recent murders linked to ICE. The urgency of his message echoes through the community, amplifying calls to abolish an agency many see as a tool of state violence. This isn’t just a policy debate; it’s a matter of lives lost and the moral imperative to confront systemic cruelty. As the Mayor noted, “Every day, we watch as people are ripped from their cars, their homes, their lives.” This stark declaration forces us to reckon with the human cost of current immigration policies.

### **The Ethics of Tech Funding: Python’s Bold Move**
In a surprising turn, the Python Software Foundation has chosen to prioritize community values over potential revenue, opting to forgo a $1.5 million grant to uphold their commitment to diversity and inclusion. This decision not only showcases ethical leadership but also signifies a growing trend where organizations prioritize values over cash flow. As they stated, “We made the decision to put our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead of seeking $1.5M in new revenue.” This isn’t just about Python; it's a beacon for other tech communities to consider what they stand for beyond profit.

### **Palantir and the Perils of Tech Dependency**
Carole Cadwalladr’s investigation into Palantir’s entanglement with national security raises alarm bells about the intersection of technology and governance. With Palantir providing “cloud support” for the UK’s nuclear weapons system, we must ask ourselves: how did we allow a private tech company, led by a radical libertarian, to wield such influence over national security? Cadwalladr emphasizes, “As a national security threat, this is off the charts.” This revelation isn’t just about tech; it’s a wake-up call regarding how we manage the delicate balance between innovation and security.

### **The Peculiar Politics of Projection**
Joe Hanson has ignited a quirky yet meaningful conversation about the Mercator projection of Greenland, highlighting how our maps can distort perceptions. His call for a boycott of this projection in news stories underscores a broader critique of how representation shapes our understanding of the world. “Until every member of the American public has seen this,” he asserts, we must question what narratives are being perpetuated. It’s a reminder that even in something as mundane as maps, there are layers of politics and representation that deserve scrutiny.

### **The Tech Landscape Post-Twitter: Reflections on Community**
Kelsey Hightower’s reflections on leaving Twitter reveal a deeper truth about online communities: it’s not about the platform, but the people. His sentiment, “I finally realized if you're posting stuff people want to follow, then they'll follow you, even when you leave,” resonates in today's fragmented digital sphere. As users migrate to newer platforms, the challenge remains: how do we cultivate meaningful connections in an era of constant change? It’s a crucial consideration for anyone trying to navigate the evolving landscape of social media. [— @kelseyhightower.com](https://bsky.app/profile/kelseyhightower.com/post/3mddr4dbs6s2v)
