### **Python’s Values Over Dollars: A Bold Move**
In a surprising turn, the Python Software Foundation has opted to prioritize community values over a hefty $1.5 million grant from the NSF. This decision isn’t just about money; it’s a declaration of intent that highlights the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech. As the foundation leaders assert, "We’re putting our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead of seeking $1.5M in new revenue," they set a powerful precedent for other tech organizations to consider what truly matters. This is a moment where ethical commitments take center stage—will this inspire similar moves across the industry?

### **The Art of Mute: Curating Your Feed**
Tristan Gray has taken the initiative to unleash a major update to his GenAI mute/block list, reminding us all of the power of curation in the chaotic world of social media. In a refreshing nod to Hayao Miyazaki, he invites users to help refine the list, showing that even in the age of algorithms, human touch matters. With platforms flooded with noise, this effort is a reminder that we can reclaim our digital environments. This update isn’t just about blocking; it’s about creating a space where meaningful conversations can thrive—one block at a time.

### **Super PACs and AI: An Unlikely Duo**
In a twist that has many scratching their heads, the president of OpenAI has emerged as the largest donor to a Trump superPAC this election cycle. This revelation raises eyebrows and questions about the intersection of technology and politics. As Jake Grumbach points out, "The largest Trump superPAC donor so far this cycle is the president of OpenAI," it seems that the influence of AI extends beyond tech and into the political arena. Are we witnessing a new age of political funding where tech moguls shape the landscape? This could be a game-changer for how AI companies are perceived in the public eye.

### **Misinformation and the AI Skepticism Wave**
Ethan Mollick is sounding the alarm on the rampant misinformation saturating discussions about AI, particularly on platforms like BlueSky. With a fervent plea, he argues that "the amount of misinformation on BlueSky about AI is insane," and warns against the dangers of dismissing AI hype as a mere trend. This skepticism could lead to a dangerous oversight where policy and ethical considerations are left unchallenged. The discussion around AI is critical, and brushing it aside only hands the reins to those who may not have our best interests at heart.

### **A New Era of Memory in AI?**
As we delve deeper into AI advancements, Everest Pipkin’s latest userscript showcases a fascinating intersection of technology and user experience—tracking cursor paths on Wikipedia. This whimsical yet practical tool is more than just a novelty; it’s a glimpse into how our interactions with information can be enhanced. Meanwhile, Eugene Vinitsky points out significant strides made by DeepSeek in offloading memory to external storage, hinting at a future where AI could operate with greater efficiency. The fusion of these concepts indicates that the way we interact with technology is evolving, raising questions about how we will manage and retain knowledge in a world increasingly reliant on AI.
