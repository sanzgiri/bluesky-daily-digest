### **Unity in a Divided Era**
In a day where unity and division seem to dance a delicate tango, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker takes a bold stance with a simple yet powerful phrase: "Unidos somos América." His message resonates against the backdrop of a nation grappling with divisive politics, reminding us that togetherness is not just a catchphrase but a necessity for genuine progress. Meanwhile, the tech world reflects this theme in its own way, prioritizing community values over profit.

### **The Price of Principles**
In a noteworthy decision, the Python Software Foundation has opted to prioritize its community's values over financial gain, rejecting a $1.5 million grant in favor of diversity and inclusion. This move isn't just about money; it’s a manifesto that challenges the tech industry's relentless pursuit of revenue at the expense of ethics. As the PSF stands firm, it raises questions about what it means to truly support diversity in tech and whether financial incentives should ever outweigh core values.

*   "The PSF has made the decision to put our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead of seeking $1.5M in new revenue." [— @python.org](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)

Tristan Gray’s latest update to the GenAI mute/block list is a refreshing take on managing your online experience—clearing out the noise so you can hear the signals that matter. In a landscape filled with misinformation and digital clutter, tools like these remind us of the importance of curating our feeds. Meanwhile, Better Things Are Possible echoes a sentiment many can relate to: the struggle to balance work positivity with the weight of the world's chaos. Are we just perpetually logging on and off, trying to dodge the bad news?

### **Mapping the Social Landscape**
Theo Sanderson's innovative map of 3.4 million Bluesky users isn't just a creative project; it's a fascinating lens through which we can examine our digital identities. As people explore their online presence, it raises broader questions about how we navigate the social web. Who are we in these vast digital landscapes, and how do our interactions shape our realities? This mapping effort could be a step towards understanding our collective behavior in a hyper-connected world.

*   "Yeah, that about feels like my presence on the internet." [— @billybobbojack.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/theo.io/post/3meezxlnecc2k)

### **The Unfolding Political Tapestry**
In a twist that's sure to ruffle some feathers, the largest donor to Trump’s superPAC this cycle is the president of OpenAI. This revelation raises eyebrows and questions about the intersection of tech innovation and political power. As AI continues its rapid development, the implications of such funding become more significant. Are we witnessing the emergence of a new breed of political influence, rooted in technology and shaped by its benefactors?

*   "ChatGPT is the equivalent of a dog scooting its asshole across the carpet threads of your brain." [— @oksytocyn.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/jakemgrumbach.bsky.social/post/3mdbzv2nfsc2k)
*   "Interested to see which universities have made deals with OpenAI..." [— @joshuasweitz.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/jakemgrumbach.bsky.social/post/3mdbzv2nfsc2k)

In a world where our digital and real lives intertwine more than ever, these themes of unity, community values, and the complexities of our online identities remind us that our connections—both virtual and physical—shape the very fabric of our society. What might tomorrow bring as we navigate this dynamic landscape?
