### **The Python Foundation Puts Values Over Cash: A Bold Move**
In a surprising twist, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) has opted to prioritize community values and inclusivity over a hefty $1.5 million grant opportunity. This decision sends a powerful message about the importance of diversity in tech, suggesting that ethical commitments can sometimes outweigh financial gain. As one PSF representative noted, “We applied for a grant to innovate, but our community’s values must come first.” This bold stance not only reflects a shift in priorities but also challenges other organizations to consider what they stand for in a world increasingly driven by profit.

* "The PSF has made the decision to put our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead of seeking $1.5M in new revenue." [— @python.org](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)
* "As a software engineer who mostly writes Python... thank you for prioritizing values." [— @gretchenleigh.zone](https://bsky.app/profile/python.org/post/3m46nxmereb2b)

### **AI: The Good, the Bad, and the Silenced**
Artificial intelligence is proving to be a double-edged sword. A recent revelation points to AI tools advising women to negotiate lower salaries—a glaring example of how technology can perpetuate systemic biases. Meanwhile, on a lighter note, some users are discovering ways to mute overly chatty AI assistants, highlighting a growing desire for control over our digital interactions. One clever user quipped, “I don’t want things to change,” underscoring the tension between embracing innovation and maintaining agency in our tech-driven lives.

### **Architecture of Exclusion: ICE's Detention Centers**
As ICE reveals plans to transform warehouses into detention centers, concerns are mounting over the implications of such actions. Visualizations of these proposed facilities, with each dot representing a detainee, paint a grim picture of human lives reduced to mere statistics. This isn't just about architecture; it’s about the ethics of housing people in facilities designed to isolate and detain. As one commenter poignantly noted, “We have all been here before,” invoking historical echoes of similar injustices that demand our attention and action.

### **The Intersection of Pop Culture and Politics**
When art meets rhetoric, it can illuminate uncomfortable truths. A recent post juxtaposes the words of historical segregationist George Wallace with modern rhetoric from Donald Trump, revealing a chilling continuity in political discourse. "There is a straight line from Wallace to Trump," one observer noted, suggesting that the appeal to fear and division remains a powerful tool in the political toolbox. This connection not only highlights the cyclical nature of political tactics but also begs the question: how do we break this cycle?

* "Trump had hit a dead spot in his speech and... began talking about n**rs." [— @sethcotlar.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/sethcotlar.bsky.social/post/3mffi4vzgs22g)

### **The Irony of SuperPACs and AI**
In a twist that feels almost satirical, the largest donor to Trump’s superPAC is none other than the president of OpenAI. This juxtaposition raises eyebrows about the ethical implications of AI development and its influence on politics. As one commentator put it, “ChatGPT is the equivalent of a dog scooting its asshole across the carpet threads of your brain,” highlighting the absurdity of this political funding landscape. It raises critical questions: Are we witnessing the merging of technology and politics in ways that could shape future governance?

* "The largest Trump superPAC donor so far this cycle is the president of OpenAI." [— @jakemgrumbach.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/jakemgrumbach.bsky.social/post/3mdbzv2nfsc2k)
* "Interested to see which universities have made deals with OpenAI." [— @joshuasweitz](https://bsky.app/profile/jakemgrumbach.bsky.social/post/3mdbzv2nfsc2k)
