### **Twitter's Exit Strategy? The Onion's Bold Move**
What happens when a satirical news outlet decides to ditch Twitter? According to The Onion's Tim Onion, it means a spike in subscribers and a much healthier online presence. With the platform becoming increasingly irrelevant for many brands, Onion quipped, “being on Twitter is somewhere between useless or detrimental,” unless, of course, you’re in the boner pill business. This sentiment reflects a growing disillusionment with Twitter as a viable marketing tool—are brands finally waking up to the reality that engagement might be better on other platforms?

### **The Digital Dilemma: Printing PDFs and Other Ruses**
Moira Donegan’s frustration with the absurdity of having to “pretend that I’m going to print something in order to save it as a PDF” strikes a chord in our increasingly digital lives. This petty annoyance is a microcosm of larger tech issues; we’re often forced into archaic behaviors by software that seems stuck in another era. It’s a reminder that while tech evolves, sometimes it leaves the user experience trailing behind, and we’re left to grapple with these quirky digital dilemmas.

### **The Social Media Cleanup Crew: Blocklists and Boundaries**
In an era where social media can feel overwhelming, Tristan Gray’s latest attempt to refine his GenAI mute/block list is a breath of fresh air. By actively engaging his followers for feedback, he's not just curating his own experience; he’s fostering a community that values a cleaner digital space. This trend highlights a growing desire among users to reclaim their feeds from noise, distraction, and negativity. It’s a proactive step toward a more thoughtful social media experience—one that prioritizes mental well-being over mindless scrolling.

### **In the Shadows of Tech: The Human Cost of AI**
With OpenAI’s president being the largest donor to Trump’s superPAC, Jake Grumbach raises eyebrows about the entanglement of tech giants and political machinations. This revelation isn’t just juicy gossip; it’s a stark reminder of how intertwined our technological future is with political agendas. As AI continues to evolve, the motivations behind its development—and the people behind those decisions—could shape the landscape of democracy itself. Are we ready for the implications of these relationships?

### **Tech Wonders: CPUs and CSS?**
In a bizarre twist of tech creativity, one user has built an x86 CPU emulator entirely in CSS, prompting the question: have we gone too far? This audacious project blurs the line between practicality and absurdity, inviting both admiration and concern from the tech community. It’s a testament to the innovative spirit of developers who push boundaries, but it also raises eyebrows about the sanity of spending time on such endeavors. Is this a sign of brilliance or a cry for help in our increasingly complex tech landscape?

* "I built an entire x86 CPU emulator in CSS (no javascript)." [— @rebane2001.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/rebane2001.bsky.social/post/3mfl4e43ig22v)  
* "How am I supposed to sleep after seeing this?" [— @jonty.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/rebane2001.bsky.social/post/3mfl4e43ig22v)

In a world where digital interactions shape our realities, from the platforms we choose to engage with to the tools we use, today’s insights remind us to remain critical of our tools and the systems that support them. After all, the digital age is as much about the experience as it is about the technology itself.
